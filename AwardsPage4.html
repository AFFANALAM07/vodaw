                    This Academy Awards (Oscars) Dashboard provides insights into actors who 
                    have won the Best Actor in a Leading Role category. Users can explore the 
                    list of actors, see the films they won for, and view the release years. 
                    The dashboard includes filters for actor names and award years, allowing 
                    users to refine the data and focus on specific individuals or time periods. 
                    For example, selecting Marlon Brando will display his Oscar-winning films, 
                    like The Godfather and On the Waterfront. This user-friendly dashboard helps 
                    users quickly discover Oscar winners and their associated films.
