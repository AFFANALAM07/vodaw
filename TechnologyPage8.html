                    <strong>Search Engine Market Trends:</strong><br>
                    
                    
                    <span><i>1).</i> Google’s Dominance:</span><br>
                    <mark>2009:</mark> 89% | <mark>2019:</mark> 92.63% | <mark>2024:</mark> 90.81%<br>
                    Google has consistently held over 89% of the market share since 2009. Its highest recorded market share was 92.63% in 2019, with a slight decline noted in 2024, indicating minor fluctuations but sustained dominance. <br><br>
                
                    
                    <span><i>2).</i> Bing’s Market Presence:</span><br>
                    Bing’s market share ranged between 1.9% and 3.7% over the years. Its highest usage was in 2024 at 3.7%, reflecting steady but limited growth.<br><br>
                
                    
                    <span><i>3).</i> Yahoo!, Baidu, and Other Competitors:</span><br>
                    Yahoo! maintained an average of 2.5% - 3.5% market share, while Baidu, Yandex, DuckDuckGo, and Ask Jeeves collectively remained below 3%, catering to niche user bases.<br><br>
                
            
                    <span><i>4).</i> Minor Players and Regional Variations:</span><br>
                    Naver and Haosou are primarily used in South Korea and China, respectively. AOL and Ask Jeeves saw significant declines over the years, almost fading from mainstream usage.<br><br>
                
                    <strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
                    Google remains the undisputed leader in search engine usage, with minor competitors maintaining limited market shares. While Bing and Yahoo! sustain steady figures, alternative search engines struggle to capture substantial global attention. The visualization enables a dynamic understanding of these trends, making it a valuable tool for market researchers and tech analysts.<br><br>
                
                    <strong>Recommendations:</strong><br>
                    <mark>Competitor Growth Strategies:</mark> Bing and Yahoo! should focus on differentiation to gain more market share.<br>
                    <mark>Regional Expansion:</mark> Search engines like Baidu and Yandex should optimize global reach strategies.<br>
                    <mark>Consumer Awareness:</mark> Promoting privacy-focused alternatives like DuckDuckGo could shift user preferences over time.
