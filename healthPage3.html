                <h4>Medical Doctors in South Asia</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>Introduction-:</strong> <br>
                    The availability of medical doctors is a critical 
                    indicator of a country’s healthcare capacity and 
                    the well-being of its population. South Asia, 
                    home to nearly a quarter of the global population, 
                    has made significant strides in increasing the 
                    number of physicians over the years. 
                    This report analyzes the trends in the number of 
                    medical doctors and the ratio of doctors per 
                    10,000 population in South Asia from 2000 to 2023. 
                    It also highlights key insights derived from an 
                    interactive visualization and slicer-enabled data 
                    exploration.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Dashboard-:</strong> <br>
                    The visualization captures the growth trajectory of 
                    physicians in each South Asian country from 2000 to 2023. 
                    Key features include: <br>
                    <span>Trend Lines:</span> Displaying year-on-year changes 
                    in the number of doctors and their ratios, allowing for 
                    easy comparison between countries. <br>
                    <span>Country-Specific Insights:</span> Users can filter 
                    data by individual nations to focus on specific progress 
                    or challenges. <br>
                    <span>Ratio Analysis:</span>The graph illustrating 
                    physicians per 10,000 population highlights disparities 
                    between countries, emphasizing the influence of population 
                    size and healthcare policies <br>
                    <span>Slicer Details -:</span>The slicer enables dynamic 
                    filtering by country and year, providing a tailored view 
                    of the data. For instance, users can explore how India’s 
                    rapid growth contrasts with Afghanistan’s slower pace or 
                    compare the ratio improvements across the region.

                    <strong>Trends in Medical Doctors</strong> <br>
                    <span>Growth in Absolute Numbers:</span> <br> 1) India leads the region with 
                    a steady rise in the number of physicians, crossing 1.5
                    million by 2023. The growth reflects the country’s 
                    investments in medical education and healthcare 
                    infrastructure. <br>

                    2) Pakistan’s medical workforce grew significantly, 
                    reaching over 275,000 doctors in 2023. <br>
                    
                    3) Other countries like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, 
                    and Nepal also exhibited consistent growth, 
                    though at a slower pace compared to India and Pakistan. <br>
                    
                    4) Smaller nations, such as Bhutan and Maldives, 
                    showed marked progress, albeit starting from much 
                    lower baselines. <br> <br>

                    <span>Physicians per 10,000 Population:</span> <br>
                    1)Maldives, despite its small size, boasts one of 
                    the highest ratios in the region, with 22.4 doctors 
                    per 10,000 population in 2023. <br>

                    2) Sri Lanka follows closely, reflecting the country’s 
                    focus on maintaining robust healthcare services. <br>

                    3) India and Pakistan, while having large absolute numbers, 
                    show moderate ratios due to their high population sizes, 
                    standing at 15.1 and 11.4 respectively by 2023. <br>

                    4)Afghanistan and Nepal lag behind, 
                    underscoring the need for enhanced medical 
                    training and healthcare investment in these nations. <br>

                    <strong>Conclusion -:</strong> <br>
                    The increase in the number of medical doctors in 
                    South Asia over the past two decades is a testament 
                    to the region’s efforts to strengthen healthcare 
                    systems. However, disparities persist, 
                    particularly in smaller or less developed nations, 
                    where further investments are required. 
                    The data underscores the importance of balancing 
                    absolute growth with equitable distribution to 
                    ensure healthcare accessibility for all. <br>
                    <strong>Recommendations-:</strong> <br>
                    Enhance medical education and training facilities across 
                    the region, with a focus on underserved areas. <br>

                    Prioritize policies that address the physician-to-population 
                    ratio, especially in countries with lower ratios. <br>

                    Leverage technology and telemedicine to bridge gaps 
                    in regions with fewer healthcare professionals.
