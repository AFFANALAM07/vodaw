                <p>
                    <strong>Introduction -:</strong> <br>
                    This report explores some of the most notable active volcanoes worldwide, focusing on their geographical distribution, 
                    physical characteristics, and recent activity. Volcanoes play a critical role in shaping the Earth’s landscape and 
                    influence local and global ecosystems. This analysis examines their types, elevations, and last known eruptions to 
                    provide a comprehensive overview. <br>
                    <strong>Dashboard -:</strong> <br>
                    This Dashboard categorizes the volcanoes by type and elevation, 
                    presenting a clear depiction of their physical characteristics. Bar charts illustrate the elevation of major volcanoes, 
                    while pie charts detail the distribution of volcano types, highlighting the predominance of stratovolcanoes.

                    <strong>Key Features of Active Volcanoes :-</strong> <br>
                    <span><i>1).</i>Geographical Distribution:</span> <br>&#8680 Volcanoes are distributed across various continents, 
                    often located along tectonic plate boundaries or hotspots. <br>
                    &#8680 Examples include Popocatépetl in Mexico, Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia, Mauna Loa in Hawaii, and Mount Erebus in Antarctica. <br> <br>

                    <span><i>2).</i>Types of Volcanoes:</span> <br>
                    <mark>Stratovolcanoes: </mark>Represent 85% of the listed volcanoes, characterized by their steep profiles and explosive 
                    eruptions (e.g., Popocatépetl, Mount Erebus). <br>
                    <mark>Shield Volcanoes:</mark> Account for 10%, noted for their broad, gently sloping shapes and 
                    effusive lava flows (e.g., Mauna Loa). <br>
                    <mark>Calderas:</mark> Formed by large-scale volcanic eruptions that collapse the volcano’s summit, 
                    comprising 5% of the sample. <br> <br>

                    <span><i>3).</i>Elevation and Activity:</span> <br>&#8680 Elevations range from 361 meters 
                    (Mount Taal, Philippines) to 5,426 meters (Popocatépetl, Mexico). <br>
                    &#8680 Many volcanoes have erupted recently, with several (e.g., Popocatépetl, Nevado del Ruiz, and Mount Erebus) 
                    showing activity in 2023. <br> <br>

                    <strong>Insights and Implications :-</strong> <br>
                    <span><i>1).</i>Risk and Monitoring:</span> <br>&#8680 Active volcanoes pose significant risks to surrounding populations and ecosystems, 
                    necessitating continuous monitoring and preparedness. <br>
                    &#8680 Regions like the Pacific Ring of Fire and the Andes are particularly vulnerable to volcanic hazards. <br> <br>

                    <span><i>2).</i>Scientific Value:</span> <br>
                    &#8680 These geological features provide invaluable insights into Earth’s interior processes and 
                    serve as natural laboratories for studying volcanic phenomena.<br> <br>


                    <span><i>3).</i>Cultural and Economic Significance:</span> <br>&#8680 Many volcanoes are integral to local cultures 
                    and attract significant tourism, contributing to regional economies. <br>
