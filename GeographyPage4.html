                <p>
                    <strong>Introduction -:</strong> <br>
                    Islands represent some of the most diverse and ecologically significant landforms on Earth. From vast expanses like Greenland 
                    to highly populated regions like Java, islands vary in size, location, and cultural importance. This report examines the key 
                    characteristics of some of the world’s major islands, focusing on their area, population, and geographical significance. <br>
                    <strong>Dashboard -:</strong> <br>
                    This Dashboard highlight the contrasts among the major islands. Bar charts compare islands by area, with Greenland 
                    dominating the size metric. Population-focused visuals showcase Java’s substantial lead in inhabitants, followed by Honshu 
                    and Great Britain. These graphics offer a clear perspective on the diversity of the world’s islands in terms of physical and 
                    demographic characteristics. <br>

                    <strong>Key Features of Major Islands :-</strong> <br>
                    <span><i>1).</i>Geographical Diversity:</span> <br>Islands are distributed across various oceans and 
                    regions, with notable examples including: <br>
                    <mark>Greenland:</mark> The largest island globally, covering an area of 2,166,086 km² in the North Atlantic, 
                    under Denmark’s jurisdiction. <br>

                    <mark>New Guinea: </mark>Shared by Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, it is the second-largest island at 785,753 km². <br>
                    
                    <mark>Madagascar: </mark>Located in the Indian Ocean, it is notable for its unique biodiversity and significant landmass of 587,041 km². <br> <br>

                    <span><i>2).</i>Population Dynamics:</span> <br> Islands also exhibit vast differences in population density and total population: <br>
                    <mark>Java:  </mark>The most populous island with 145 million inhabitants, showcasing its role as a cultural and economic hub in Indonesia.<br>
                    <mark>Great Britain: </mark> Home to 67 million people, reflecting its historical and geopolitical influence <br>
                    <mark>Greenland: </mark> Despite its size, it has a sparse population of only 56,000, highlighting its harsh climatic conditions.<br> <br>

                    <span><i>3).</i>Cultural and Economic Significance: </span> <br>&#8680 Islands like Honshu (104 million people) in Japan and Luzon 
                    (64 million) in the Philippines serve as economic powerhouses and cultural centers in their respective countries.<br> <br>


                    <strong>Insights and Implications :-</strong> <br>
                    <span><i>1).</i>Ecological Importance:</span> <br>&#8680 Islands like Madagascar are biodiversity hotspots, 
                    requiring conservation efforts to protect endemic species. <br>

                    &#8680 Climate change poses significant risks, particularly to low-lying and densely populated islands.<br> <br>


                    <span><i>2).</i>Strategic and Economic Roles :</span> <br>
                    &#8680 Many islands serve as critical trade hubs, cultural centers, and geopolitical assets.<br> <br>


                    <span><i>3).</i>Challenges:</span> <br>&#8680 Remote islands often face challenges like limited infrastructure, 
                    vulnerability to natural disasters, and economic isolation. <br>
