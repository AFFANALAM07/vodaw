                    <strong>Trends in the no. of Medical Doctors</strong> <br>
                    <i>1) </i>
                    <mark>Uzbekistan:</mark> 
                    

                    The number of physicians fluctuated from 73,400 in 2000 to 95,600 in 2023.

                    A period of steady decline was observed between 2000 and 2015, followed by a significant recovery.<br>
                    <i>2)</i> <mark>Kazakhstan:</mark>
                    

                    The number of doctors increased from 49,000 in 2000 to 76,300 in 2023.
                    
                    Kazakhstan experienced a consistent rise, with a notable acceleration post-2010. <br>
                    <i>3)</i> <mark>Tajikistan:</mark>
                    
                    
                    A relatively low number of physicians, ranging from 13,500 in 2000 to 19,700 in 2023.
                    
                    Growth has been slow but steady, with notable progress post-2015. <br>
                    <i>4)</i> <mark>Kyrgyzstan:</mark>
                    
                    
                    The medical workforce grew from approximately 21,500 in 2000 to 23,500 in 2023.
                    
                    The trend remained mostly stable, indicating moderate improvements. <br>
                    <i>5)</i> <mark>Turkmenistan:</mark>
                    
                    
                    Numbers declined from 27,100 in 2000 to 19,300 in 2023, showing a concerning downward trend.
                    
                    The decrease suggests challenges in healthcare workforce retention and training. <br> <br>

                    <strong>Physicians per 10,000 Population:</strong> <br>
                    <i>1)</i> <mark>Uzbekistan:</mark> Declined from 29.6 in 2000 to 23.1 in 2023, indicating 
                    slower growth relative to population increase. <br>
                    <i>2)</i> <mark>Kazakhstan:</mark>

                     Maintained a strong ratio, increasing from 31.6 in 2000 to 
                     37.5 in 2023, highlighting a robust healthcare workforce. <br>
                    <i>3)</i> <mark>Tajikistan:</mark>
                     Fluctuated around 19 per 10,000, indicating 
                    room for improvement. <br>
                    <i>4)</i> <mark>Kyrgyzstan: </mark>
                    
                    Ratio declined slightly from 27.1 in 2000 to 19.3 in 2023, suggesting population growth outpacing medical workforce expansion. <br>
                    <i>5)</i> <mark>Turkmenistan:</mark>
                     Decreased from 27.1 to 19.2, reflecting systemic issues in doctor retention and recruitment. <br>

                    <strong>Conclusion -:</strong> <br>
                    While some Central Asian nations have made commendable progress in strengthening their healthcare workforce, disparities remain. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan lead in workforce expansion, while Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan exhibit concerning declines. The region needs targeted policies to address healthcare gaps, ensure equitable distribution of physicians, and invest in medical education.
