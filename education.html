                <h4>State-wise Number of Teachers among Social Groups​</h4>
                <p>
                    This dashboard visualizes the number of teachers across various
                    social groups, offering insights into diversity within the teaching profession.
                    Social categories such as gender, caste, and socio-economic backgrounds are
                    analyzed to highlight inclusivity and representation.
                    The dashboard features three controls: year, state name, and social category,
                    allowing users to filter data accordingly. Two pie charts display
                    the number of teachers by social category and gender distribution,
                    providing a clear view of disparities and trends in the teaching workforce.

                <h4>Expenditure on Education by Indian Goverments</h4>
                <p>
                    Expenditure on education by both the education 
                    department and other government departments plays 
                    a pivotal role in shaping the overall educational 
                    landscape of a country. This expenditure is often 
                    categorized by sector, reflecting the allocation of 
                    resources to specific areas of education, research, 
                    and related activities. The education department is 
                    typically entrusted with the primary responsibility 
                    of formulating policies, managing educational 
                    institutions, and overseeing the implementation of 
                    academic programs.
