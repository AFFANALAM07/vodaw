                    <strong>Key Trends in Student Enrollment -:</strong> <br> <br>
                    <span> 1) Enrollment Growth:</span> <br> <br>
                    Primary Education: Enrollment figures experienced fluctuations, rising from 
                    348,000 in 2005 to 387,000 in 2020, indicating a steady increase in participation. <br> <br>

                    Lower Secondary Education: Enrollment showed consistent growth, moving from 242,000 
                    in 2005 to 271,000 in 2020. <br> <br>

                    Upper Secondary Education: Enrollment stabilized over the years, reaching 266,000 in 
                    2020 compared to 263,000 in 2005. <br> <br>

                    <span> 2) Gross Enrollment Ratios (GER):</span> <br> <br>
                    Primary Level: GER for males was 101.3% and for females 99.3% in 2020, reflecting near-
                    universal participation. <br> <br>

                    Lower Secondary Level: GER for males reached 103.6% and for females 102.3%, showcasing 
                    high enrollment rates. <br> <br>

                    Upper Secondary Level: GER demonstrated significant gender differences, with males at 
                    152.3% and females at 144.6% in 2020, possibly due to over-age enrollment or re-enrollment. <br> <br>

                    <span>3) Gender Dynamics:</span> <br>

                    Both genders displayed high GER at all levels, with males showing slightly higher 
                    participation at the upper secondary level. <br>

                    The data underscores consistent gender balance, with minor variations across years.

                    <strong>Insights and Implications-:</strong> <br> <br>
                    <span>1) Access to Education:</span> <br> 
                    High GER across all levels indicates robust policies ensuring access to education 
                    for all children and adolescents. <br>

                    The fluctuations in primary education enrollment suggest demographic shifts and 
                    the impact of migration. <br> <br>


                    <span>2) Quality and Retention:</span> <br> 
                    Stable upper secondary enrollment figures reflect successful retention strategies, 
                    though over-age enrollment patterns warrant further exploration. <br> <br>

                    <span>3) Gender Equality:</span> <br> 
                    Close GER values for males and females highlight New Zealand’s progress 
                    in achieving gender parity in education.

                <p class="description">
                    <strong>Conclusion -:</strong> <br> 
                    New Zealand’s education system demonstrates strong performance 
                    in enrollment and gender parity across primary and secondary levels. 
                    While challenges such as over-age enrollment persist, 
                    the overall trends reflect a stable and inclusive education environment. 
                    Future efforts should focus on sustaining these achievements and addressing 
                    areas of concern to further enhance educational outcomes.
