                    <strong>Key Trends in Student Enrollment -:</strong> <br>
                    <span> 1) Enrollment Numbers:</span> <br>
                    Primary Education: Enrollment declined from 18.7 million in 2005 to 15.4 million in 2020, 
                    reflecting demographic changes and transitions in the education system. <br> 

                    Lower Secondary Education: Enrollment decreased from 15.0 million in 2005 to 13.1 million in 2020, 
                    showing a similar pattern as primary education. <br>
                    Upper Secondary Education: Enrollment showed a slight decline, moving from 9.7 million in 2005 to 
                    9.1 million in 2020, but remained relatively stable compared to other levels. <br>


                    <span> 2) Gross Enrollment Ratios (GER):</span> <br>
                    Primary Level: GER for males was 102.9%, while for females, it reached 106.7% in 2020, 
                    indicating near-universal enrollment at this level. <br>

                    Lower Secondary Level: GER for males increased to 137.2%, with females reaching 133.9% in 2020, 
                    highlighting over-age enrollment due to repeating grades. <br>

                    Upper Secondary Level: GER for males rose to 91.5% and females to 85.5%, 
                    reflecting ongoing efforts to expand access to higher education levels. <br>

                    <span>3) Gender Trends:</span> <br>

                    Female students consistently exhibited higher GER at the primary and lower secondary levels, 
                    while male students led at the upper secondary level. <br>

                    The narrowing gender gap at all levels indicates progress toward gender parity in education. <br>
                </p>  
                
                <p>
                    <strong>Insights and Implications-:</strong> <br>
                    <span>1) Access to Education:</span> <br> 
                    Declining enrollment numbers suggest demographic shifts and a need to focus on quality and retention.

                    GER trends reflect efforts to ensure universal access, though challenges remain at the upper secondary level. <br>

                    <span>2)Quality and Retention:</span> <br> 
                    Over-age enrollment, indicated by GER above 100%, underscores the need for interventions to improve progression rates. <br>

                    <span>3)Gender Equality:</span> <br> 
                    
                    Continued emphasis on female education is crucial for achieving equity and empowering women through education.

                    <strong>Conclusion -:</strong> <br> 
                    Brazilâ€™s education system has made strides in improving access and addressing gender disparities at all levels. 
                    However, challenges such as declining enrollment numbers and over-age participation must be addressed to ensure 
                    sustainable progress. Policy initiatives should prioritize retention, quality improvement, and gender equity 
                    to strengthen educational outcomes.
                </p> 
                
                <p>
                    <strong>Recommendations -:</strong> <br> 
                    1) Implement targeted programs to reduce over-age enrollment and improve grade progression. <br>

                    2) Strengthen retention strategies, particularly at the upper secondary level. <br>
                    
                    3) Invest in gender-focused initiatives to further close the education gap.
