                    <strong>Key Trends in Student Enrollment -:</strong> <br> <br>
                    <span> 1) Enrollment Growth:</span> <br> <br>
                    Primary Education: Student enrollment increased from 127.8 million
                    in 2005 to a peak of 138.4 million in 2010, stabilizing at approximately
                    131.3 million by 2022. <br> <br>

                    Lower Secondary Education: Enrollment grew from 51.6 million in 2005 to 
                    66.9 million in 2022, reflecting expanded access to middle-level education. <br> <br>

                    Upper Secondary Education: Enrollment rose significantly from 37.8 million 
                    in 2005 to 72.1 million in 2022, demonstrating progress in higher education
                    accessibility.<br> <br>

                    <span> 2) Gross Enrollment Ratios (GER):</span> <br> <br>
                    Primary Level: The GER for males reached 112% and for females 110.7% by 2022, 
                    indicating near-universal access. <br> <br>

                    Lower Secondary Level: GER for males increased from 90.5% in 2005 to 98.3% in 
                    2022, while females saw an improvement from 78.9% to 90.7% over the same period. <br> <br>

                    Upper Secondary Level: GER for females rose from 47.4% in 2005 to 72.2% in 2022, 
                    narrowing the gender gap. <br> <br>

                    <span>3) Gender Disparities:</span> <br><br>

                    <span>1) Access to Education:</span> <br> 
                    The consistent growth in enrollment and GER reflects policy efforts to 
                    improve access to education, including schemes like the Sarva Shiksha 
                    Abhiyan and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan. <br> <br>

                    <span>2)Challenges in Retention:</span> <br> 
                    Dropout rates remain a concern, particularly in transitioning from

                    <span> 1) Enrollment Numbers:</span> <br> <br>
                    Primary Education: Enrollment declined from 18.7 million in 2005 to 15.4 million in 2020, 
                    reflecting demographic changes and transitions in the education system. <br> <br>

                    Lower Secondary Education: Enrollment decreased from 15.0 million in 2005 to 13.1 million in 2020, 
                    showing a similar pattern as primary education. <br> <br>

                    9.1 million in 2020, but remained relatively stable compared to other levels. <br> <br>


                    <span> 2) Gross Enrollment Ratios (GER):</span> <br> <br>
                    Primary Level: GER for males was 102.9%, while for females, it reached 106.7% in 2020, 
                    indicating near-universal enrollment at this level. <br> <br>
