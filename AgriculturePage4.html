                    <Strong>Insights and Implications -:</Strong> <br>

                    <span>Trade balance:</span> 
                    Afghanistan’s import volumes exceed export volumes significantly, suggesting a trade 
                    imbalance that could be addressed through enhanced production and export diversification. <br>

                    <span>Opportunities for Growth::</span>
                    Expanding infrastructure for processing and packaging agricultural goods can boost 
                    export competitiveness. <br>  Promoting high-value exports, such as almonds and anise, 
                    can enhance revenue. <br>

                    <span>Challenges:</span>
                    Limited export growth suggests logistical, infrastructural, or market access challenges that 
                    need resolution for sustained economic development.
                </p>

                <p class="description">
                    <Strong>Conclusion -:</Strong> <br>
                    Afghanistan’s agricultural trade is characterized by a diverse portfolio of imports and 
                    exports, with potential for growth in high-value commodities. Addressing trade imbalances 
                    through infrastructure development, market expansion, and value addition is critical for 
                    leveraging the agricultural sector as a driver of economic growth.

                <p class="description">
                    <Strong>Recommendations -:</Strong> <br>
                    Invest in agricultural processing facilities to improve product quality and export value. <br>

                    Strengthen trade policies and partnerships to expand market access.
                    
                    Develop sustainable agricultural practices to ensure long-term productivity and trade resilience.
