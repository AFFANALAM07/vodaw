                <p>
                    <strong>Introduction-:</strong> <br>
                    The availability of medical doctors is a crucial factor 
                    in determining the efficiency and accessibility of 
                    healthcare systems. West Asia, a region with diverse economies 
                    and healthcare infrastructures, has experienced substantial 
                    changes in the number of physicians and their distribution relative 
                    to the population. This report examines the trends in the 
                    number of medical doctors and the ratio of doctors per 10,000 people
                     across multiple countries in West Asia from 2000 to 2023. 
                     The interactive visualization and slicer functionality 
                     provide an in-depth exploration of these trends, 
                     helping policymakers and researchers analyze disparities 
                     and progress in the healthcare sector.
