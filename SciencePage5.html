                <h4>Digestive Juices and Enzymes: Their Role in the Human Body</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>Introduction:-</strong> <br>
                    The human digestive system relies on various glands and enzymes 
                    to break down food into absorbable nutrients. Digestive juices 
                    and enzymes play a crucial role in converting complex macronutrients 
                    into simpler forms, ensuring efficient absorption and energy production. 
                    This report examines the major glands involved in digestion, 
                    their secretions, and the enzymatic processes that facilitate 
                    nutrient breakdown. <br>
                    <strong>Dashboard:-</strong> <br>
                    The visualization presents a structured representation of the digestive process: <br>
                    <mark>Organ-Wise Breakdown: </mark>Each gland is linked to its secretions and enzyme functions. <br>
                    <mark>Step-by-Step Conversion Process:</mark> Tracks the transformation of macronutrients at different stages of digestion. <br>
                    <mark>Categorical Segmentation:</mark> Highlights enzymes responsible for carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism. <br>
                    <mark>Nutrient Absorption Indicators:</mark>Demonstrates how the small intestine absorbs simple sugars, amino acids, 
                    and fatty acids into the bloodstream. <br> <br>
                    <span>Slicer Functionality :-</span>The slicer feature enhances user interaction 
                    by allowing them to filter data based on specific glands, enzymes, 
                    or nutrient breakdown processes. This enables targeted exploration 
                    of digestive functions and their physiological significance.
