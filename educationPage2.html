                    This dashboard on "National & State Universities in India" offers an intuitive way to explore
                    and analyze data related to different types of universities across the country. It categorizes
                    universities into groups like Central Universities, State Public Universities, and Deemed
                    Universities,
                    allowing users to easily filter and view specific categories. The dashboard provides a state-wise
                    distribution
                    of universities, where users can interact with the visual elements to see the number of institutions
                    in each state.
                    Users can compare university types across different states using charts and other visual aids. By
                    clicking on various
                    charts and filters, users can dynamically adjust the data presented to focus on their specific areas
                    of interest.
                    This makes it simple for users to understand the higher education landscape in India.

                <p class="description">
                    This dashboard presents state-wise enrollment data for undergraduate (UG), diploma, and postgraduate
                    diploma (PG-Diploma)
                    levels, separated by gender for each state or union territory in 2021-22. The top section shows
                    enrollment figures at the UG level,
                    with the distribution of male and female students displayed as stacked bar charts for each state.
                    Similarly, the middle
                    section represents diploma-level enrollments, and the bottom section focuses on PG-Diploma levels.
                    The blue bars indicate
                    male enrollments, while the pink bars represent female enrollments, allowing for a clear comparison
                    of gender distribution
                    across different educational levels and states. Users can easily identify the total enrollment
                    figures and gender proportion
                    in each category by observing the respective bars.
